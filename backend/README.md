# E-Vote Backend


## Project Overview

E-Vote is a secure and scalable voting platform designed to handle elections of various scales. This backend folder contains the RESTful API endpoints that manage user authentication, election creation, voting operations, and result retrieval.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
├── app/
│   ├── models.py             # Database models (Election, Candidate, Vote, User)
│   ├── routes.py             # API routes (authentication, elections, votes)
│   ├── services.py           # Business logic (create, retrieve, update, delete operations)
│   └── __init__.py           # Flask application initialization
├── migrations/               # Database migrations (created by Flask-Migrate)
├── tests/                    # Unit tests (using pytest)
├── config.py                 # Configuration settings (database URI, JWT secret key)
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
└── run.py                    # Entry point to run the Flask application
```

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up the database URI in `config.py`.

3. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

The backend server will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

Adjust the placeholders (`YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`, `your_username`, `your_password`, etc.) in the curl commands according to your actual implementation and setup. This README provides a structured overview of your project, explains its setup and usage, and offers sample curl commands for testing various endpoints. Adjust and expand it further based on your specific project details and requirements.
